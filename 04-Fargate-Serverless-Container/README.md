# 04-Fargate-Serverless-Container ðŸš€

---

## **Overview**

- **What we are doing**:  
   We are deploying the **AWS Features Explorer App** as a containerized microservice using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) on Fargate. The app will be pulled from Docker Hub and deployed on AWS infrastructure, allowing it to run serverless without managing any underlying infrastructure.

- **Why we are doing it**:  
   Using ECS with Fargate enables serverless container deployment, eliminating the need to provision or manage servers. This setup simplifies scaling, reduces infrastructure management efforts, and allows focus on the application itself. Docker Hub provides a centralized repository for hosting container images, making it easy to share and deploy.

- **Real-Life Use Case**:  
   Large companies like **Airbnb** use serverless technologies like Fargate to scale applications dynamically without worrying about managing servers. For example, when users book accommodations or experiences, the backend services scale automatically, handling the increased traffic seamlessly.

   In our project, we are leveraging ECS Fargate to deploy a Docker-based application from Docker Hub, providing scalability and serverless infrastructure management.

## **Tools and Technologies**

- **AWS ECS Fargate**: For serverless container orchestration.
- **Docker Hub**: To pull the pre-built container image.
- **Nginx**: As the web server inside the Docker container.
- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging container activity.

## **Steps to Implement the Project**

### **Step 1: Prerequisites**

Ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- **Docker** is installed locally, and you're familiar with pushing and pulling images from Docker Hub.
- Your **AWS account** is set up, and you have permissions to create resources like ECS clusters and ECR repositories.

### **Step 2: Use Prebuilt Docker Image from Docker Hub**

1. **Pull the Docker image** from Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker pull swapnilyavalkar/aws-features-explorer-app:latest
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container locally** to test the app:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 80:80 swapnilyavalkar/aws-features-explorer-app:latest
   ```
   - Access the app on `http://localhost` to verify it's working.

---

### **Step 3: Set Up ECS Cluster**

1. **Open the ECS Console**:  
   Navigate to the **ECS** service in the AWS Management Console.

2. **Create a New ECS Cluster**:  
   - Choose **Networking only (Fargate)** and click **Next Step**.
   - Name your cluster (e.g., `AWSFeaturesExplorerCluster`).
   - Configure VPC and subnets as per your setup.
   - Click **Create**.

---

### **Step 4: Create ECS Task Definition**

1. **Create a New Task Definition**:  
   - Choose **Fargate** as the launch type.  
   - Click **Create new Task Definition** and name it (e.g., `AWSFeaturesExplorerTask`).

2. **Define Container Settings**:  
   - Set up your container configuration:
     - **Container name**: `AWSFeaturesExplorerContainer`
     - **Image**: Use the Docker Hub image `swapnilyavalkar/aws-features-explorer-app:latest`.
       - Since this image is being pulled from Docker Hub (an external registry), you need to configure the task definition to explicitly pull from Docker Hub by specifying the full image URL (`docker.io/swapnilyavalkar/aws-features-explorer-app:latest`).
     - **Memory**: Choose memory (e.g., 512 MB).
     - **Port mappings**: Set container port to `80` (since Nginx uses port 80 by default).
   - Click **Add**.

3. **Allow ECS to Pull Images from Docker Hub**:  
   You must update your ECS task execution role to allow ECS to pull Docker Hub images:
   - Attach the `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` policy to the task role (e.g., `ecsTaskExecutionRole`) so ECS has permission to pull Docker images from external registries.
   - Ensure the IAM role you are using has the necessary permissions for external registry access.

4. **Task Role**:  
   Ensure the task execution role (e.g., `ecsTaskExecutionRole`) is attached. This allows ECS to pull images from Docker Hub and send logs to CloudWatch.

5. **Create Task Definition**:  
   Click **Create** to finalize the task definition.

---

### **Step 5: Create ECS Service**

1. **Create a New Service**:  
   - Go to the **Services** tab in the ECS Console.  
   - Click **Create**.
   - Select the task definition created earlier (`AWSFeaturesExplorerTask`).
   - Choose **Fargate** as the launch type.
   - Set the number of tasks to **1**.

2. **VPC and Networking**:  
   - Choose the appropriate VPC and subnets where the service will run.
   - Enable **Auto-assign public IP** if your service needs to be publicly accessible.

3. **Load Balancer (Optional)**:  
   If you need to expose the service publicly, you can configure an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to route traffic to the ECS service.  
   - Attach an ALB and create a target group for port **80**.

4. **Service Scaling** (Optional)**:  
   Set up auto-scaling if needed.  
   Click **Create Service**.

---

### **Step 6: Test the Service**

1. **Retrieve the Public IP**:  
   If your service is exposed publicly, navigate to the **Tasks** tab, select the running task, and copy the **public IP**.

2. **Access the Application**:  
   Open the browser and access `http://<public-ip>`.  
   The **AWS Features Explorer App** should be running with Nginx.

---

### **Step 7: Enable CloudWatch Logging**

1. Ensure CloudWatch logs are enabled in the **task definition**.
2. Go to the **CloudWatch Console** to verify the logs from the container.

---

### **Step 8: Clean Up Resources (Optional)**

1. After the project is complete, clean up the resources to avoid unnecessary charges:
   - Delete the ECS service and cluster.
   - Remove any unused VPC resources and subnets.

## **Summary of Key Concepts**

- **Amazon ECS**: Container orchestration service that allows you to run microservices.
- **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based repository where you store Docker images.
- **Fargate**: A serverless compute engine for containers.
- **Nginx**: A web server used for serving content within the Docker container.
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging service to collect logs and metrics from ECS tasks.
